      <description>Project summary What makes a collection of interacting species (that is, a community) stable or not to an external perturbation? Part of the complexity of the question lies in what we mean by ‘stable’, and also by ‘a collection of interacting species’. This PhD aims to contribute humbly to answering this question, using a combination of analytical and numerical approaches. This relies on a number of challenges.&#xA;First, stability recovers many distinct meanings in ecology.</description>

      <description>Project summary The aim of this Ph.D. thesis is to study the feedbacks and interdependencies in ecological systems at different spatial scales and levels of organization, as well as the emergent processes arising from them. Such a cross-scale conceptual framework, integrating the different types of feedbacks as well as the emergent phenomena arising from them, is lacking.&#xA;Project publications B. Pichon, I. Gounand, S. Donnet, S. Kéfi.&#xA;The interplay of facilitation and competition drives the emergence of multistability in dryland plant communities.</description>

      <description>Project summary Global changes are threatening ecosystem functioning and the vital services they provide to human societies, imposing an urgent need to understand how they are coping with and reacting to global change. The complexity of ecosystems, however, makes predicting their fragility a difficult endeavor. This project focuses on a critical scenario in ecosystem degradation: large and abrupt transitions following gradual environmental changes, observed across ecosystems worldwide. Despite important progresses, key knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning these transitions, making them notoriously difficult to predict.</description>

      <title>Identifying early warning signals of catastrophic shifts in ecosystems</title>

      <description>With the current global change, it is becoming increasingly important for us to be able to anticipate shifts in ecological communities. Shifts are often responsible for large, long-lasting changes and can result in dramatic ecological and economic consequences. Are there early warning signs that an ecosystem is loosing resilience?&#xA;Generic indicators, that can be quantified on the temporal and spatial dynamics of ecosystems, have been identified in the literature. In addition, for terrestrial ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent transitions in ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of facilitation for ecosystem dynamics and resilience</title>

      <description>In harsh environments, individuals can modify their habitat and make it more hospitable for themselves and/or others by relieving the environmental stress. Although evidence on the importance of such positive interactions is accumulating in a wide range of ecosystems, they are largely ignored by current models in ecology. Including positive interactions into ecological theory may be key to understanding population and community processes in physically stressful habitats. Studies already showed that positive interactions in the form of habitat amelioration can have profound effects on the spatial distribution of organisms, on their abundance, and on ecosystem resilience.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the role of the diversity of interaction types in nature</title>

      <description>In ecological communities, interactions between species form complex networks that mediate their response to perturbations. So far, ecological network studies have typically focused on one (or a few) interaction types at a time, but data and models of webs including different interaction types simultaneously have recently become available. How and when does the diversity of interactions matter for the dynamics and resilience of ecological systems? My recent research aims at analyzing ecological networks including different types of interactions.</description>
