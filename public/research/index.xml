      <description>With the current global change, it is becoming increasingly important for us to be able to anticipate shifts in ecological communities. Shifts are often responsible for large, long-lasting changes and can result in dramatic ecological and economic consequences. Are there early warning signs that an ecosystem is loosing resilience?&#xA;Generic indicators, that can be quantified on the temporal and spatial dynamics of ecosystems, have been identified in the literature. In addition, for terrestrial ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent transitions in ecosystems.</description>

      <description>In harsh environments, individuals can modify their habitat and make it more hospitable for themselves and/or others by relieving the environmental stress. Although evidence on the importance of such positive interactions is accumulating in a wide range of ecosystems, they are largely ignored by current models in ecology. Including positive interactions into ecological theory may be key to understanding population and community processes in physically stressful habitats. Studies already showed that positive interactions in the form of habitat amelioration can have profound effects on the spatial distribution of organisms, on their abundance, and on ecosystem resilience.</description>

      <description>In ecological communities, interactions between species form complex networks that mediate their response to perturbations. So far, ecological network studies have typically focused on one (or a few) interaction types at a time, but data and models of webs including different interaction types simultaneously have recently become available. How and when does the diversity of interactions matter for the dynamics and resilience of ecological systems? My recent research aims at analyzing ecological networks including different types of interactions.</description>
