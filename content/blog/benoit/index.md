## Project summary

The aim of this Ph.D. thesis is to study the feedbacks and interdependencies in ecological systems at different spatial scales and levels of organization, as well as the emergent processes arising from them. Such a cross-scale conceptual framework, integrating the different types of feedbacks as well as the emergent phenomena arising from them, is lacking.
