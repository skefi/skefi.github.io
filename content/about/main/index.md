intro: |
  I am a researcher at the CNRS based in the [EEC team](https://eec.edu.umontpellier.fr/) at the Institut des Sciences de lâ€™Evolution de Montpellier [(ISEM)](https://isem-evolution.fr/), France. I am also an external professor at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://santafe.edu/) (NM, USA). 

  My research aims at understanding how ecosystems adapt to perturbations. What makes ecosystems resilient to changes and what makes them fragile?

  I combine mathematical modeling and data analysis to investigate the role of ecological interactions (in particular facilitation) in stabilizing and destabilizing ecosystems, but also to develop indicators of resilience that could warn us of approaching ecosystem shifts.
